summary: Learnings from load testing a web application
---

I conducted a tech sharing across several teams about what I have learnt during my work on load testing my team's web application.

The slides for the tech sharing can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iW4ldHB9jixET-9N_1HdAJhRAEb-Xr8aWY0NIadMe3A/edit?usp=sharing).

I used an open-source testing tool called [k6](https://k6.io) to help me with my load tests.
K6 is created using golang and allows the test creators to write tests in Javascript/Typescript.

I also used [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) to help generate mock data for my test database running on MongoDB.
Having the load test executed on a pre-seeded database helps to simulate actual use during production.

```js
// Sample code for mocking data
const user = {
  _id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
  name: faker.datatype.string(20),
}
```

This helps us identify potential performance pitfalls, since incorrectly created indexes will result in inefficient querying,
resulting in a longer query time.

I shared on how to create indexes correctly with the use of the [ESR rule](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/equality-sort-range-rule/).
This means that indexes created must follow the order of equality, sort and range to allow them to be executed.

Given an example query below:

```js
db.getCollection('people')
  .find({
    emp_id: { $gt: 20 },
    company_id: '57d7a121fa937f710a7d486d',
  })
  .sort({ last_name: -1 })
```

The most efficient way to create the index following the ESR rule is:

```js
{
  company_id: 1
  last_name: -1
  emp_id: 1
}
```
