The AWS ASEAN Summit conducted in May 2023 brought an insight to the latest cloud technologies developed by AWS and adopted by many various companies. This event provided me the opportunity to network with people from various organisations to learn about how they utilise the cloud to develop their solutions.

It was certainly very crowded attending a conference hosted post-pandemic, but it was a very fruitful conference to learn more about AWS and how other companies are leveraging the cloud to build their solutions.
