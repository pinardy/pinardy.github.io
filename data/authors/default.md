# Background

I graduated with a major in Information Systems Technology and Design from [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/).

I started programming in 2016 in university. I have been exposed to many different fields such as web development, data science, internet-of-things and more. I have been working as a full-stack web developer.

I am an independent learner who is highly motivated to learn and try out new technologies. I believe in livelong learning.

# Personal Interests

### Music

Music has always been a part of me from young. I started learning the piano from young and joined the chinese orchestra in my middle and high school. I started learning the violin on my own in 2021 and have been playing the violin leisurely in my free time.

### Baking

I enjoy baking in my own free time, making sweet treats for family and friends.
